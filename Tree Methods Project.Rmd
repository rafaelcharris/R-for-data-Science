Get the Data
Call the ISLR library and check the head of College (a built-in data frame with ISLR, use data() to check this.) Then reassign College to a dataframe called df
```{r}
library(ISLR)
df <- College
head(College)
```

EDA
Let's explore the data!

Create a scatterplot of Grad.Rate versus Room.Board, colored by the Private column.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(College)+ 
  geom_point(aes(x=Grad.Rate, y=Room.Board, col = Private)) + 
  theme_bw()
```

Create a histogram of full time undergrad students, color by Private.

```{r}
ggplot(College) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x=F.Undergrad, fill = Private), col ='black', position = 'identity')
```

Create a histogram of Grad.Rate colored by Private. You should see something odd here.

```{r}
ggplot(College) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x=Grad.Rate, fill = Private), col = 'black', position = 'stack') +
  theme_bw()
```
